    "In the previous video we have seen how to add a fernet key in order to encrypt sensitive data in the\n",
    "\n",
    "metastore of Airflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve further the security of your Airflow instance is by rotating your fernet key. Indeed, like\n",
    "\n",
    "you would do with your passwords, changing your key at an interval of time is a best practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how you can we set a new key without breaking anything?\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind is that changing your old key by a new one directly from the airflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "cfg file will cause decryption of existing credentials to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a little process to follow in order to rotate the fernet without invalidating existing\n",
    "\n",
    "encrypted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s do this. [Term]From your terminal, exit the docker container by hitting control-D, then type “docker ps”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, execute the command “docker exec -it”,\n",
    "\n",
    "the container id of the web server\n",
    "\n",
    "“/bin/bash”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter. Now open your code editor open the file generate_fernet_key from the folder\n",
    "\n",
    "docs. Copy the command, and paste in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter. And we got a new key. Copy it and\n",
    "\n",
    "open the file airflow.cfg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for the parameter fernet_key\n",
    "\n",
    "and paste the new key before the old one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here. add a comma and that’s it. Save the file. Go back to your terminal and execute the command “airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "rotate_fernet_key”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter. You shouldn’t get any error neither a success message.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in order to check that everything worked as expected, exit the container by hitting control-D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, execute the previous command we used to connect to the postgres database, this one. Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the same sequel request that we used to access the connection my_conn\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we compare the last few characters of the encrypted password with the old one we got previously,\n",
    "\n",
    "we can see that they are different,\n",
    "\n",
    "meaning the rotation has been well made. Perfect. Before moving forward, since the new key has been applied\n",
    "\n",
    "we can remove the old one from the airflow.cfg file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like that. Save the file. Exit the container,\n",
    "\n",
    "restart the web server\n",
    "\n",
    "and we are done. All right,\n",
    "\n",
    "actually there is one more thing I would like to show you. As a best practice,\n",
    "\n",
    "you should avoid storing your fernet key in the configuration file of Airflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because if you push it accidently on a repository, anybody will access to your fernet key and so be able\n",
    "\n",
    "to decrypt your credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to avoid this is by leveraging environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, Airflow allows you to configure it through environment variables like we do from the\n",
    "\n",
    "docker compose files. So, from your code editor, copy the Fernet key here and remove it. Then, open the file\n",
    "\n",
    "docker-compose-CeleryExecutor.yml and below the environment section in the web server\n",
    "\n",
    "service,\n",
    "\n",
    "type “- AIRFLOW__CORE__FERNET_KEY\n",
    "\n",
    "=” and paste the key. Like that. Whenever you want to configure a parameter of Airflow through an\n",
    "\n",
    "environment variable, the nomenclature is always the same. Specify airflow in first. Then two underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the section where the parameter is. Either core, scheduler and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can actually find the section in the file airflow.cfg where the name will be between two square\n",
    "\n",
    "brackets, then two underscores and the name of the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here, we are setting this value to the parameter fernet key, in the section core in Airflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the variable and paste under each component of Airflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file, and restart the docker containers\n",
    "\n",
    "by executing the script restart.sh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok Airflow is running, type docker\n",
    "\n",
    "ps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then docker exec -it,\n",
    "\n",
    "the container id of the web server,\n",
    "\n",
    "/bin/bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter. Type “env”,\n",
    "\n",
    "and we got the environment variable airflow__core__fernet_key\n",
    "\n",
    "we defined as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have learned how to rotate your fernet key, how to configure Airflow through environment variables,\n",
