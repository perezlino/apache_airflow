    "\n",
    "the Airflow UI is extremely recommended. In this video we are going to discover the different steps to follow\n",
    "\n",
    "in order to set up the authentication system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started. [VS]From you code editor, check that you are under the section airflow-materials/airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "-section-9 and open the file airflow.cfg in mnt/airflow. From there, look for the\n",
    "\n",
    "parameter authenticate under the section web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may guess, this parameter is used to enable the authentication on Airflow. Meaning, accessing the UI\n",
    "\n",
    "would be allowed only if you have a user account with a login password set. So defined the parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we have to add a new parameter just below, in order to indicate the backend that will be requested\n",
    "\n",
    "for authentication. Type: auth_backend\n",
    "\n",
    "= airflow.contrib\n",
    "\n",
    ".auth.backends\n",
    "\n",
    ".password_auth\n",
    "\n",
    "Like that. As you can see here, multiple backends are actually available with Airflow. If you copy this,\n",
    "\n",
    "then from your web browser, paste the string, enter, then click on the first link, here you got the different\n",
    "\n",
    "backends that you can configure such as Github, Kerberos, LDAP and so on. By the way, if you want a video\n",
    "\n",
    "about one of these backends, don’t hesitate to reach me. All right,\n",
    "\n",
    "back to the code editor. We can save the file and open the Dockerfile under the folder docker/airflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to set up password authentication with Airflow, the passwords will be hashed by using the\n",
    "\n",
    "module bcrypt. bcrypt is a password hashing function in order to encrypt your password in a very secure\n",
    "\n",
    "manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "I won’t go into the details here, since it's a bit technical, but if you are interested, don’t hesitate\n",
    "\n",
    "to take a look at the bcrypt hash function. In order to make available this function, we have to install\n",
    "\n",
    "a new package on the container running Airflow which is flask-bcrypt. So, just below a pip install\n",
    "\n",
    "command,\n",
    "\n",
    "like here,\n",
    "\n",
    "type : && pip install\n",
    "\n",
    "flask-bcrypt.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t do this,\n",
    "\n",
    "the web server will throw you an error indicating that the package is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, save the file. Everything is set up,\n",
    "\n",
    "we can restart the docker container running Airflow. From your terminal,\n",
    "\n",
    "execute restart.sh.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, since we made a modification in the Dockerfile, Docker needs to rebuild the docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m gonna pause the video right now and I will come back when it is done. Ok,\n",
    "\n",
    "the image is built, let’s type docker ps to check that the containers are running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open your web browser, and type localhost:8080.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter. Perfect. This time, instead of having the usual DAGs’s view a login and password are required in order to\n",
    "\n",
    "access the UI and go further.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait a minute, we didn’t create any user account don’t we? Exact, time to create a new user. To do this,\n",
    "\n",
    "Airflow doesn’t bring a command line tool for creating accounts but by executing a little script provided\n",
    "\n",
    "from the documentation, we can easily create one. By the way,\n",
    "\n",
    "don’t be mistaken with the commands related to the Role Based Access Control feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "User accounts created here, are not the same when RBAC is enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, let’s move forward. Back to your terminal, type “docker exec -it”\n",
    "\n",
    "copy and paste the container id of the web server,\n",
    "\n",
    "“/bin/bash”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter. Ok. In your code editor, open the file generate_user in the folder docs, copy\n",
    "\n",
    "the code, then start the python interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "and paste the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter. So here we just have created a new user account with the username admin and the password sets\n",
    "\n",
    "to admin as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go back to the Airflow UI, and type “admin” for both login and password fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sign in”. And we are logged in to the Airflow UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "So each time you want to create a new user, just execute the code snippet from the file generate\n",
    "\n",
    "_user. Before moving to the next video,\n",
    "\n",
    "there is one more thing I would like to show you. At the beginning of the course, when you discovered\n",
    "\n",
    "the UI for the first time, I told you quickly about the column “Owner” here, and that we will see later\n",
    "\n",
    "how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well this is it. Thanks to the owner parameter defined in your DAGs,\n",
    "\n",
    "you can decide to hide those which are not owned by the current connected user. By default,\n",
    "\n",
    "DAGs are automatically assigned to the owner Airflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we open the file airflow.cfg and look for the parameter “default_\n",
    "\n",
    "owner”,\n",
    "\n",
    "we obtain the value “airflow” as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you want to change it to another account,\n",
    "\n",
    "feel free to do it. Then, if we look for the parameter “filter_by\n",
    "\n",
    "_owner”.\n",
    "\n",
    "and set it to True, only the DAGs belonging to the logged in user will be shown on the DAGs view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file and go to your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exit the container by hitting control D and restart the webserver by typing: docker-compose\n",
    "\n",
    "f\n",
    "\n",
    "docker-compose-CeleryExecutor.yml restart webserver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok the web server is restarted. Back to the UI, refresh the page and as you can see all the DAGs disappeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because no DAGs belong to the user admin\n",
    "\n",
    "we just created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check this. In your code editor, open the folder mnt/airflow/dags, make a copy\n",
    "\n",
    "of the file marketing_\n",
    "\n",
    "dag.py\n",
    "\n",
    "and open it. Replace the dag id by “admin_dag” for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "and set the owner to admin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file. By doing this, we have defined that this DAG belongs to the user admin and so, should be\n",
    "\n",
    "visible from the user interface. Back to the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep refreshing the page and at some point the DAG should pop up. Here it is. Perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you have learned how to activate the password authentication system on your Airflow instance as well\n",
    "\n",
    "as filtering DAGs by owners so that any sensitive DAG can be filtered.\n",
    "\n",
    "All right.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you enjoyed this video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a quick break and see you for the next one.\n"
