    "All right  in this video, we are going to put into practice the Kubernetes Executor.  First you need to install VirtualBox  if it’s not already done. Open your web browser and go to virtualbox.org  then click on this big button in order to download virtual box.  Then, choose the platform you are using such as windows, linux or Mac OS. The install of VirtualBox is  pretty straightforward,  , if you have any troubles don’t hesitate to reach me in the Q/A section.  The other thing you need to install is vagrant. Vagrant allows to set up development environments  based on a configuration file name Vagrantfile.  If you go to your code editor and open the file “Vagrantfile” under the folder airflow-materials  /airflow-section-5/vagrant-files,  you can see that it describes how to set up the different vms that we gonna use in order to create  our Kubernetes cluster of three nodes  The Kubernetes master node here and the worker nodes here.  Back to your web browser, go to vagrantup.com,  then click on “Get Started”,  then “Getting Started” and “Install”. From there,  all the instructions needed to install Vagrant are given.  It’s pretty easy to install as well but again, if you get any troubles, don’t hesitate to reach me in the  Q/A section. All right,  from there I assume that Vagrant and VirtualBox are installed on your computer.  Open your terminal and make sure that you are under the folder airflow-materials/airflow-  section-5. Go to vagrant-files with “cd vagrant-files”. Then, we have to add  two plugins to Vagrant before starting our Kubernetes Cluster. To do this,  execute the command “vagrant plugin  install  vagrant-vbguest  vagrant-  scp”.  Enter. Those plugins will be useful to benefit from the functionalities of VirtualBox and enable to  move files using “scp”. “scp” is a way to copy and paste files through the SSH protocol.  Ok now, the plugins are installed, we can start the Kubernetes cluster by typing “vagrant up” inside  the folder vagrant-files.  Keep in mind that you have to stay in this folder in order to interact with your VMs with Vagrant.  Why?  Because Vagrant needs the Vagrantfile that you can find here by typing “ls”, to know which VMs  are you referring to.  Since starting the VMs takes time to finish  I’m going to pause the video right now and I will come back when it is done. Ok,  the VMs are running as you can check by typing “vagrant status”.  We can now open a session to the master node. To do this, type “vagrant  ssh master”.  Enter, and we are connected to the master. Type “kubectl get nodes” in order to check that the  kubernetes cluster nodes are ready.  Perfect.  At this point if it’s not the case for you,  you can either wait like two minutes or quit the VM by hitting “control-D” like that, and restart the  nodes that are not “ready” from the output here.  For example, let’s say the node worker-1 is not ready,  we can type “vagrant  reload  worker-1”,  enter and wait for the reload to finish.  All right,  now we can go back to the master as we did with “vagrant  ssh master”.  Enter.  Then, “kubectl get nodes”  and all nodes are ready.  OK  this video and the following videos are not about how to use Kubernetes.  I’m not going to explain how kubernetes works as it is a totally different topic and I would need  to create an entire course for it.  Again, I just wanted to point out that I’m really going to focus on Airflow with the Kubernetes Executor.  Nonetheless if you have any questions feel free to ask me in the Q/A section of the course.  Ok. Now we are going to install Rancher in order to manage our Kubenertes cluster. Rancher is a  complete solution for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters.  Basically, it makes simple what you will take a lot of time to set up with the Kubernetes command line  interface by providing a nice and friendly user interface. If you want to learn more about it,  I strongly encourage to take a look at their website  rancher.com. In order to set up Rancher  It's pretty easy.  Open a new terminal,  check that you are under the folder airflow-materials/airflow-section  -5  and execute  the following command. “docker run -d  --restart=unless-stopped  -p 80:80  -p  443:443  --name rancher  rancher/  rancher  :v2.3.2”.  Enter.  Check that container is running by typing “docker  ps”.  Perfect. Now, if we go the browser,  and type localhost,  then “Advanced”,  “Proceed to localhost”,  we get the welcome page of Rancher. From there, type “admin” as password  and click on “Continue”. Here,  you need to give your local ip address to Rancher. Back to your terminal,  if you are using Mac OS, you can type “ifconfig”,  then here, copy the ip address.  Back to your browser, paste the IP address here.  Don’t worry about the warning message and click on “continue”.  we are on the Rancher UI. Click on “add cluster” and “Import an existing cluster”. Set “airflow”  as cluster name  and click on “Create”.  Here, we are going to execute the last command on the master node of the cluster in order to import the  cluster into Rancher.  So click on the button right there  to copy the command. Then, from your terminal, go to the session where you are connected to the master,  paste the command and hit Enter.  Ok. Now back to the browser, click on “Done\"  and wait a minute or two until the status of the cluster turns from “pending” to “active”.  All right,  now the cluster is active  let’s move forward.  If you click on it, you land on a dashboard summing up information about your cluster. You can see the  number of core cpus available, the memory available, the maximum number of Pods this cluster  can run as well as the number of current running Pods. Also, the 4 boxes shown in green here  correspond to the different kubernetes components that we have seen in the previous video.  You can click on “Nodes” in order to know which node consumes what. By clicking on master  for example, you even get more information such as if there is enough disk space orc memory.  The status of the current node. The system information and so on. Click on “Cluster” to get back to the  dashboard.  Alright, now everything is set up,  it’s time to install Airflow on the Kubernetes Cluster using Rancher  "
