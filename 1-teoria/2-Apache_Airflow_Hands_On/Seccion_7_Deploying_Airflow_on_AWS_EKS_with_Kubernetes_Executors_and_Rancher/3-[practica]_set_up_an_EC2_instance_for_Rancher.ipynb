    "\n",

    "\n",
    "don't forget to terminate it.\n",

    "Ok, I assume that you are already logged in your AWS account, if it’s not the case,\n",

    "take your time to do it, then once you are connected, go to the EC2 service.\n",

    "Some are free tier eligible and for some others you have to pay for their usage.\n",

    "Select the first image “Amazon Linux 2”. Then, you have to choose the configuration of your instance, such\n",
    "\n",
    "as the number of virtual CPUs, the amount of memory, the instance storage and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, since Rancher requires at least 2 gigabytes of memory, we have to select the “t2.\n",

    "“Next”. We keep the configuration settings by default,\n",

    "\n",
    "rule in order to unblock the ports 80 and 443 needed to run Rancher. Click twice on “Add Rule”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, instead of Custom TCP we select “HTTP” for the first rule,\n",

    "Here it is. Wait for the instance state to be in running state.\n",
