    "Finally the best part. In this video we are going to install and execute our first DAG using Airflow through\n",
    "\n",
    "the Kubernetes Executor inside our EKS cluster. As we did for the nginx ingress,\n",
    "\n",
    "we are going to use Catalogs in order to install Airflow in the cluster. Since I already made a chart\n",
    "\n",
    "for running Airflow with the KubernetesExecutor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to add the catalog where the template is. Click on “airflowekscluster”, “Global”, “Apps”,\n",
    "\n",
    "and “Manage Catalog”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we need to add a new catalog with the name “airflow-eks”.\n",
    "\n",
    "and type the URL “https://github.com\n",
    "\n",
    "/marclamberti\n",
    "\n",
    "/airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "-helm-chart.git”\n",
    "\n",
    "all right now click on Create\n",
    "\n",
    "Check that the branch “master” is well selected and the scope is global. If your scope is not global by\n",
    "\n",
    "default, close the window and repeat the previous steps we did to add a new catalog. Before clicking\n",
    "\n",
    "on create, verify that you have the same inputs as mine and if everything is ok, click on the button.\n",
    "\n",
    "The catalog has been added and is active, we can install Airflow. Click on “Apps”, “Launch”, and select “airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "-kubernetes-eks”. As we did for the nginx-ingress, we need to define a name, let’s say\n",
    "\n",
    "airflow-eks\n",
    "\n",
    "The template version is the latest. The target project is default under the airflowekscluster. We keep\n",
    "\n",
    "the upgrade strategy and switch the role from “Project” to “Cluster”. Good. Click on “Launch” to start deploying\n",
    "\n",
    "Airflow on the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, next to the “nginx-ingress” app, airflow is installing. Click on it. From there, wait for workloads,\n",
    "\n",
    "“postgres”, “scheduler” and “web” to be active and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can take up to 10 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "so in the meantime, you can click on any workload to get more information about what is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to put the video right now and come back when everything is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "All right,\n",
    "\n",
    "at this point you should have the same output than me with all workloads in active state and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you go on “Apps”, then select nginx-ingress\n",
    "\n",
    "and click on the endpoint just below the nginx controller service,\n",
    "\n",
    "you will land on the Airflow user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well done,\n",
    "\n",
    "you have a fresh new install of Airflow running inside your EKS cluster with the KubernetesExecutor\n",
    "\n",
    "configured. To show you that I’m not lying,\n",
    "\n",
    "let’s execute some tasks. Before doing this,\n",
    "\n",
    "select your cluster from the top left corner and run kubectl by clicking here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are connected, type “kubectl get namespaces”\n",
    "\n",
    "and copy the namespace starting by airflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, type “watch kubectl get pods\n",
    "\n",
    "-n”, and paste the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter. This command allows you to watch your pods in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we trigger a DAG, you should be able to see your tasks running from this view in your Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster. In the Airflow UI,\n",
    "\n",
    "turn on the toggle of the DAG parallel_dag and go back to the Rancher UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, PODs corresponding to your tasks are running inside your EKS cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "with the Kubernetes executor.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's it for this video.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you have learned everything you need to set up your own EKS cluster with airflow running\n",
    "\n",
    "and configured with the Kubernetes executor.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in learning more about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please don't hesitate to reach me in the Q/A section of Udemy or by messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be happy to answer you. Now, let's take a quick break and see you for the next video.\n"
