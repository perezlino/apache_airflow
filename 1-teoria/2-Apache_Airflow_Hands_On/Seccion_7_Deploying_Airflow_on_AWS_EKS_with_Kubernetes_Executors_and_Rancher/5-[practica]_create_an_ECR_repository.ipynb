    "In the previous video we have set up an EC2 instance running Rancher and created a new user with\n",
    "\n",
    "the permissions on AWS services.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video we are going to configure an ECR repository in order to store, manage and deploy Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "container images. An ECR can be useful in the context of a CI/CD pipeline where you will push\n",
    "\n",
    "your image containing your DAGs and update your Airflow instance with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let’s begin. From you AWS console,\n",
    "\n",
    "look for the service ECR\n",
    "\n",
    "and click on “Get started”. One important thing to mention is that ECR is not free.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost is quite cheap like $0.09 cts per gigabyte transferred but it’s good to know that you\n",
    "\n",
    "can be charged for using this service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay here,\n",
    "\n",
    "the first thing to do is to give a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s put “airflow”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that you can set a namespace before the name. It’s a good practice so that you could divide\n",
    "\n",
    "your repositories by environments such as dev, staging and prod.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, we can click on “create repository”, and that’s it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The repository airflow is created, we are able to push docker images into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order to push the docker images we need to install the AWS command line interface. Open a\n",
    "\n",
    "new tab and search for “installing AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "CLI 2”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the first result\n",
    "\n",
    "and at the bottom of the page, you can choose between links according to your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I’m on MacOS, I click here and just follow the instructions. So let’s copy this, then from a\n",
    "\n",
    "terminal,\n",
    "\n",
    "paste the commands to execute them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I type my password,\n",
    "\n",
    "and the tool is installed. If I type “aws2 --version”,\n",
    "\n",
    "I get the following output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, now we need to configure the tool with the user security credentials we created earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you still have the file credentials.csv as we gonna use it. Type “aws\n",
    "\n",
    "2 configure”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here,\n",
    "\n",
    "copy and paste your access key id from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the secret access key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default region name you want to use. In my case it’s eu-west-3. We keep the default output\n",
    "\n",
    "format, and we are done. Now, from the ECR dashboard, at the top of the page, if you click here,\n",
    "\n",
    "you can access the push commands. Again, choose the operation system corresponding to yours and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, copy this line, paste it in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t forget to change aws by aws2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we got “Login succeeded”. The next step is to build the docker image. Check that you are in the folder airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "-materials/airflow-section-7 then open the folder “docker”. Here, we have a Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "file with the configuration file airflow.cfg in config as well as the entrypoint.sh file\n",
    "\n",
    "in script. You should already be familiar with those files since they are the same as the ones we used\n",
    "\n",
    "in the previous videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference is that this time, the kubernetes package is installed as well since we are\n",
    "\n",
    "going to use Airflow with the KubernetesExecutor. So, type the command “docker build -t airflow\n",
    "\n",
    ".”\n",
    "\n",
    "And wait for the build to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, then we need to tag the docker image in order to push it into our ECR repository. From your\n",
    "\n",
    "web browser, copy this command\n",
    "\n",
    "and paste it. Instead of latest, give a version to your docker image so that you know which version\n",
    "\n",
    "is running in your cluster. Also if you want to rollback and add minor fixes is always a best practice\n",
    "\n",
    "to keep this format. Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "the newly created and tagged image by typing “docker image ls”,\n",
    "\n",
    "and if we scroll up,\n",
    "\n",
    "here it is. Good, now the last step is to push the docker image. From your web browser copy the last command, paste it\n",
    "\n",
    "in your terminal change latest to “v1.0”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can take a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, it’s done. If we go back to the browser and close the instructions, then click on the repo, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "the docker image airflow with the tag “v1.0” as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, each time you want to pull this image, you will just need to copy and paste this link.\n",
    "\n",
    "All right that's it for this video.\n",
