    "In this video I’m going to give you a quick overview of AWS EKS. You should already be\n",
    "\n",
    "familiar with Docker and Kubernetes so I won’t talk about them again.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not, I strongly recommend you to take a look at the videos “Docker Reminder” in section 3 and “Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Reminder” in section 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said let's move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is AWS EKS? If you already use AWS services,\n",
    "\n",
    "you may have heard about AWS ECS for Elastic Container Service.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS ECS came before AWS EKS and is a provider-specific solution for running\n",
    "\n",
    "and managing docker containers in the cloud. While Kubernetes is an open-sourced container orchestrator,\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon made the choice to go with a proprietary solution which is AWS ECS but something was\n",
    "\n",
    "missing. In 2017 AWS announced the support of Kubernetes with AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "EKS for Elastic Kubernetes Service. EKS is a managed service for Kubernetes, where users can easily\n",
    "\n",
    "deploy, a high-available, scalable and fully managed Kubernetes control-plane on AWS. Like with\n",
    "\n",
    "ECS, the goal of EKS is to make your life easier by managing what cause you a lot of pain\n",
    "\n",
    "when you start dealing with Kubernetes. EKS is well integrated now in AWS and can be used with\n",
    "\n",
    "different services such as Amazon ECR for container images, Elastic Load Balancing or ELB for load\n",
    "\n",
    "distribution,\n",
    "\n",
    "IAM for authentication and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me show you the kind of Kubernetes architecture we usually want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have three availability zones A, B and C in order to maintain a high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for each zone, we would need to set up a master node, an etcd instance which is the datastore\n",
    "\n",
    "of Kubernetes and once everything is setup, we could start deploying kubernetes worker nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, basically you need to manage by your own, three master nodes,\n",
    "\n",
    "three etcd instances and many kubernetes worker nodes all spread among different availability zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is, a lot of things can fail and it will be up to you to do the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "So before EKS, if you really wanted to set up your own Kubernetes cluster in AWS you would\n",
    "\n",
    "have made a lot of effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now things are easier since EKS manages your master nodes and etcd instances for you. It will automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "scale and repair your services if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, it runs the control plane instances\n",
    "\n",
    "across the zones and detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances. If you don’t remember\n",
    "\n",
    "what is a control plane in Kubernetes, it’s where you have your etcd instance, kube-controller, kube\n",
    "\n",
    "-apiserver and so on running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically it’s everything you don’t want to deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, even if EKS is in charge of the biggest part, you still need to create the kubernetes worker nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "along with IAM roles, VPCs, Subnets, SSH keys and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that even this part can be easier to set up by using a tool like Rancher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, I hope it’s clear now about what is EKS and the clear benefit of using it. Before moving\n",
    "\n",
    "to the next video\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to give your a big warning. Indeed,\n",
    "\n",
    "EKS is not free and a cluster costs\n",
    "\n",
    "around 20 cents per hour which is 144 USD per month. Also, we will pay for\n",
    "\n",
    "EC2 instances so it can be quite expensive if you forget to stop running your EKS cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "as well as all the other resources. Don’t worry\n",
    "\n",
    "I will show you how to clean everything as well\n",
    "\n",
    "at the end of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok now it’s time to move forward and set up Airflow with the Kubernetes Executor running on AWS\n",
    "\n",
